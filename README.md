## About the Project

As part of the final project of this bootcamp I was assigned a project entitled Tasks App. The goal was to design a web application that lets you create tasks tables to help organize your day-to-day responsibilities. The three main aspects of this web app is that we programmed it using Vue 3 while also applying HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was also necessary to use Vercel to launch the live page and Supabase to handle the backend aspect of the project.

These were the guidelines established to develop the project:

- [x] Creation of account: users will be able to register in the application through a Sign Up process, log in with Log In and log out with Log Out.
- [x] Task management: users will be able to create, edit, mark/unmark as completed and delete tasks.
- [x] Data storage: the application will be connected to Supabase and all the information of the tasks and users will be saved on that platform.
- [x] State management: Pinia stores will be used to connect with the backend and control the state of the application.
- [x] Navigation: Vue Router will be used to navigate the page without having to do a refresh.
- [x] Single Style: A single style file (assets/style.css) will be created and correctly inserted into main.js to access the classes and component ids.
- [x] Responsive design: the page will be responsive and will have at least two versions: mobile and desktop.
- [x] Deployment: the application will be deployed in Vercel.
- [x] Handling of asynchronous operations: asynchronous operations will be handled correctly with promises or async/await.
- [x] Documentation: a work path will be maintained in the repository's readme, updating it daily.

* As an added value to the requirements, I added a priority selection button for the tasks tables where users can specify the status of their project by importance.

### Built With

This project was built with VUE 3, using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. To launch the project to the web we used Vercel and for organizational structure and security issues regarding the progress GitHub was used for updating and monitoring the project. We also used Supabase to handle authentication and backend. It was cool to learn a bit of backend as well.

## About

This is my first solo project for the Front-End Development Bootcamp and first time ever learning about programming. I am originally an advertising creative, but worked three years in a company dedicated to AI doing Language Data Analysis. For this reason, I was interested in exploring more profundly the world of tech and programming. It has definitely been a challenge! There's been lots of laughter and tears, but definitely worth the ride.

## Acknowledgment

I want to thank the three teachers of this bootcamp in Ironhack; Diego Zito, Jarko Garrido and Aleix Abuli. Thank you for your time, all the information provided, your patience and the extra hours to help us solve all kinds of doubts. Big thanks to my partner in crime during this journey, Ikerne. Without you this would've been impossible. Finally, I'd like to thank the SOC for facilitating this course so that I can continue to grow professionally.

## Technical Challenge

My first challenge was Vue.3! In my mind this is a very abstract framework. The quantity of components and how to reference code correctly in each was overwhelming for me.

The second challenge was CSS. The struggle of trying to understand how to reference correctly in a short period of time intensified in the design aspect of the project. I might have underestimated CSS a bit if I want to be honest, given the fact that I'd executed it greatly in the midterm. Never again!

For this reason, the design of my project is very simple. I call it an ode to the 90's <3

## Big Mistake

One of my biggest mistakes throughout this project was not making precise annotations in all of my coding. This would've helped much more with my difficulties I had referencing code in different component windows and then with CSS.

Another big mistake was not understanding glitches and sudden changes in the format of my page, for both the desktop and the mobile version. I would sometimes spend hours trying to figure out how something I hadn't touched, changed another element that had nothing to do with what I as working with... or so I thougt. A couple of times, I had to face the decision of writing another code that worked and forget about the hours I had already put in. In the end, you have to do what you have to do to get it done!
